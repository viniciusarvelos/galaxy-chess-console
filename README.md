## **GALAXY CHESS**

A galaxy themed chess game developed in C# with a console interface.

This project was developed during the "Complete C# Course" on Udemy with the assistance of Professor Nelio Alves. 
I made personal modifications to the interface and change theme to 'Galaxy'. The white pieces are now Rebel (Blue)
and the black pieces are Empire (Red). I also implemented the ability to choose which piece the Peon turns during the special
move "Promotion".
